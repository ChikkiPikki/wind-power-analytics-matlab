Measures the ocean surface winds
- Winds modulate air-sea exchanges of heat, momentum, gases, particulates
- Can affect full range of ocean movement
___
It is an active microwave instrument, unaffected by clouds
[[Back-scatter]] ($\sigma_{0}$) is sensitive to 
1. Surface wind
2. Soil moisture: due to water content of soil
3. Ice age
___
In the microwave region, there are categorized channels just like VIBGYOR in the visible region. Ku band and C band are in the $\mathrm{cm}$ range, and scatterometers used for detecting ripples of that size are calibrated to that range.
