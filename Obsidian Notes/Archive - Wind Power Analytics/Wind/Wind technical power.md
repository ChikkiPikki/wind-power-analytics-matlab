WPD would be used

Power curve:
1. Cut in speed: minimum speed of wind for wind turbine to generate power
2. Rated output speed
3. Cut out speed: wind turbine at this speed would be under fatigue load. turbine locks at this wind speed
![[Wind specific#Syntax for power generation]]
___
[[Scatterometers]] derived winds are at 10m. For hub height:
$$
v_{h}=v_{0}\left( \frac{\log\left( \frac{h}{z_{0}} \right)}{\log\left( \frac{10}{z_{0}} \right)} \right)
$$

Array spacing: $D^{2}{\times v_{df}}\times v_{uw}$

Buoy winds are point winds
____
Variability analysis
Mean annual variability:
$$
MAV = \frac{1}{J}\sum_{j=1}^{J} \frac{s_{u}(j)}{m_{u}(j)}=\frac{1}{J} \sum_{j=1}^{J}CV(j)=\langle CV \rangle 
$$

Interannual variability:
