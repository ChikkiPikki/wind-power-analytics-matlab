Sending a pulse, and getting back a part of that pulse. 
## Dependency of backscatter on wind speed

1. **Smooth surface**: minimum backscatter
2. **Slightly rough surface**
3. **Rough surface**: maximum backscatter

To get ripples, [[Scatterometers]] have to look at a side angle.

Backscatter response depends on the relative angle between the pulse and capillary wave direction

- At different angles, the strength of backscatter is different
- We see the same region from different angles and measure backscatter
- The conical antenna rotates to get backscatter from different angles, sends different types of pulses, and get different pulses. We then solve the equation for these values.
- Using different angles and polarization the [[Scatterometers|scatterometer]]
